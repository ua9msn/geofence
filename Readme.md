## Test/Start project for Map with Geofence

Before everything, by the reason of having no time:
1. Deletion of a geofence is not implemented.
2. Map/EditControl.js is a copypaste of react-leaflet-draw plugin with one single line change. 
   The original version doesn't work as I need.
4. No tests

## Local

`yarn install & yarn start`

## Demo
 not implemented yet
